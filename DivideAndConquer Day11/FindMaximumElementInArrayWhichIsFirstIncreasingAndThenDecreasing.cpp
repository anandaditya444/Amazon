We can modify the standard Binary Search algorithm for the given type of arrays.
i) If the mid element is greater than both of its adjacent elements, then mid is the maximum.

ii) If mid element is greater than its next element and smaller than the previous element then maximum lies on
left side of mid. Example array : {3, 50, 10, 9, 7, 6}

iii) If mid element is smaller than its next element and greater than the previous element then maximum lies on
right side of mid. Example array: {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 3, 1}

int findMaximum(int arr[], int low, int high)
{

/* Base Case: Only one element is present in arr[low..high]*/
if (low == high)
		return arr[low];

	/* If there are two elements and first is greater then
	    the first element is maximum */
	if ((high == low + 1) && arr[low] >= arr[high])
		return arr[low];

	/* If there are two elements and second is greater then
	    the second element is maximum */
	if ((high == low + 1) && arr[low] < arr[high])
		return arr[high];

	int mid = (low + high) / 2; /*low + (high - low)/2;*/

	/* If we reach a point where arr[mid] is greater than both of
	    its adjacent elements arr[mid-1] and arr[mid+1], then arr[mid]
	    is the maximum element*/
	if ( arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1] && arr[mid] > arr[mid - 1])
		return arr[mid];

	/* If arr[mid] is greater than the next
	    element and smaller than the previous
	    element then maximum lies on left side of mid */
	if (arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1] && arr[mid] < arr[mid - 1])
		return findMaximum(arr, low, mid - 1);

	// when arr[mid] is greater than arr[mid-1]
	// and smaller than arr[mid+1]
	else
		return findMaximum(arr, mid + 1, high);
